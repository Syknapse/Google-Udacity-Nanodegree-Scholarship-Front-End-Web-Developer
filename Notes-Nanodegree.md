## Responsive CSS

To make sure media always stay in its container create a global reset in the CSS doc

```css
img, embed, object, video {
    max-width: 100%;
}
```

Tip: Mobile 'tap' elements should have `48px` minimum height and width. A margin of `40px` to separate it from close items if not big enough.
